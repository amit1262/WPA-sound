\section{experiment setup}
For computing the accuracy of our system, we collected audio samples from sound source at different angles (0, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 135, 150, 180). Multiple samples [how many????????????] were collected from each position. Then we compared the estimated angle with the ground truth giving us the accuracy of angle estimation by our system. It is interesting to study if distance between sound source and the smartphone has any impact on the accuracy of angle estimation. So, we also varied distance between the source and smarpthone from 1 meter to 2 meters and 3 meters. For each value of distance, we collected multiple samples from each angle and estimated angle for each sample. 

Experiments were done inside a meeting room [dimensions please????????????] with very low noise (low ambience noise). The sound used for the experiment is a white noise [cite it please ?????????]. The selection of specific music is arbitrary and angle estimation is independent of type of white noise chosen.

The smarpthone used for experiments is Samsung S5 running Android v4.4.2 (kitkat) with 2 GB of RAM and quad-core 2.5 GHz of CPU clock. This smartphone has one microphone at the top and the other at the bottom.
